#             TWO-FACTOR AUTHENTICATION (2FA) TEST SCRIPT           #
# ================================================================= #
# This script tests the full 2FA lifecycle:
# 1. Creates a new user.
# 2. Enables 2FA for that user.
# 3. Simulates a login that triggers the 2FA challenge.
# 4. Verifies the 2FA code provided by the user.
# 5. Tests the 'resend code' functionality.
# 6. Disables 2FA to clean up.
# ================================================================= #

# --- Configuration ---

# --- State Variables ---
# Holds the full-access JWT after a successful login.
ACCESS_TOKEN=""
# Holds the temporary token issued after password verification, used for 2FA.
